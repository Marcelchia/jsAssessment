# jsAssessment

Q)What did you like about this project?

Its a very good test as Javascript as it really put the coding logic to the test. Alot of relevant application is involved 

Q)What did you struggle with in this project?

I took really long to come up with the randomise playing field as there were too many errors. After that was done, it was relatively smooth sailing. 

Q)What would make your experience with this assessment better?

More time is needed for this as i feel it was very rushed to come up with logics fast enough. 
Also, if there is a way to teacg us how we can improve our logical thinking it would be great
